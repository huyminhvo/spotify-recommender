## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone & Create Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spotify-recommender.git
cd spotify-recommender
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate    # (Windows)
source venv/bin/activate # (Mac/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧠 CLI Usage <a name="cli-usage"></a>
You can also (alternatively) run the recommender directly from the command line.

```bash
python cli.py --playlist "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4bvPBOdMcU0dVJQqP86upR" --top_n 20
```

Example output:
```bash
[cache] Using cached merged_xxx.parquet
Top 20 recommended tracks:

2. Artist – Track
...
```
